                        I built this simple website for my final project in 76-211, Model Minorities?: Introduction to Asian American History, at Carnegie Mellon University. For this final project, we had to come up with an alternate idea to have a creative take on the issues about Asian Americans we want to explore. I decided to do my project on a memoir, Crying in H Mart, by Michelle Zauner because I recently read this book! I think this book had a very deep emotional effect on me because I could vividly imagine the detailed scenery and the food description while reading.

                    <p>
                        My final project uses the popular format of self-categorization (similar to MBTI) to perform an intervention in Asian American identity studies. Instead of focusing on external issues like discrimination or laws, I want to explore the internal emotional strategies people use to navigate their lives. By forcing users to choose a specific 'type,' the project actually proves that these boxes don't work. The fact that there are eight distinctive categories just to capture the experience of one person (Michelle Zauner) demonstrates that Asian American identity is too complex to be defined by just one role! Ultimately, the project uses the limitations of a quiz to show that no single label can truly contain the complexity of our experiences.

            <p>
                A few things to keep in mind before you start: The eight categories in this quiz are an interpretive framework I created to navigate the complex themes of Crying in H Mart. While subjective, they are designed to help you reflect on the book and your own experiences, rather than trying to definitively summarize Zauner's entire life. Below, I have also connected these categories to key readings and concepts from our class to provide deeper context. I hope you find the analysis insightful and have fun with the quiz!

            <h3>(1) Connection to "Dear Elia: Letters from the Asian American Abyss"</h3>
            <p>
                My project uses the idea of "pedagogy of unwellness" from Professor Khúc, which basically means that feeling sick, sad, or stressed (unwell) is not a personal failure, but a normal reaction to a broken world. Khúc wants us to stop blaming ourselves and stop seeing sadness as an "individual pathology". The quiz helps do this by showing that roles like The Griever and The Outsider are products of structural violence (like racism and the Model Minority myth), not personal flaws. I am using the quiz to help people name their suffering and realize that they are not alone in their brokenness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Khúc insists that we need new languages and methods for talking about mental health that aren't just what doctors or counselors typically tell us. My quiz is an alternate media form that acts as one of those new ways to talk. Instead of giving a diagnosis, it gives a cultural role (like "The Translator" or "The Preserver"). By focusing on care through food, culture, and memory (the themes of Crying in H Mart), the project helps students explore their pain through a humanities lens, which Khúc argues is essential for building better community care.

            <h3>(2) Connection to "Passing for Perfect: College Imposters and Other Model Minorities"</h3>
            <p>
               My quiz directly relates to what Professor Ninh calls the "success frame"—that strict checklist of accomplishments (like getting straight A's and becoming a doctor) that many Asian American families believe is the only way to be successful and worthy. Ninh says this is more than a goal; it's an identity. My categories, like The Preserver and The Pragmatist, show how much emotional energy and stress people put into following that checklist. We use the quiz to show that the reason people feel so much pressure in Crying in H Mart is because they are constantly worried about "passing for perfect"  and avoiding the huge shame of failure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ninh argues that being Model Minority is a performance you have to put on, even if it hurts you inside. My quiz shows the different ways people deal with this performance. The Performer makes art out of it, and The Negotiator keeps the peace to make things look smooth. The biggest takeaway from Ninh is that if you fail the performance, the alternative (being labeled a complete failure) feels even more intolerable. By categorizing people's coping styles, my project shows the internal price of this performance and proves that the emotional choices in the memoir are actually survival strategies against the pressure to conform.

            <h3>(3) Synopsis of Crying in H Mart</h3>
            <p>
                Crying in H Mart is a Memoir by Michelle Zauner where she goes through exploration of grief, family, and cultural identity centered on the author's relationship with her Korean mother, Chongmi, following her diagnosis and eventual death from cancer. Zauner, a Korean American musician (who performs under the name Japanese Breakfast), structures the narrative around food as the primary language of love and cultural connection in their lives. The book vividly recalls the Korean dishes and rituals that defined her childhood and later became her desperate, yet essential, means of preserving her mother's memory and heritage. The title itself refers to the emotional experience of breaking down in the aisles of H Mart, a Korean American supermarket, where the sight of familiar ingredients evokes overwhelming sadness and nostalgia for the mother and the culture they shared.

            <h3>(4) Model Minority Myth</h3>
            <p>
                The Model Minority myth is a concept that represents Asian Americans as a uniform, successful group, achieving high levels of educational and economic prosperity through hard work and compliance. It functions as an identity, a set of aspirations focused on high-status professional fields like medicine, law, or engineering, and earning a degree from an elite university. This narrative sets an high standard, creating immense pressure on individuals to avoid the shame of failure and adhere to a strict success frame. Critical studies address the negative consequences of the "model minority" label, including internalized pressure and emotional burnout by many Asian ethnic groups.

            <h3>(5) Immigrant Biculturalism Experience</h3>
            <p>
                Immigrant biculturalism is the experience of navigating and integrating two distinct cultural frameworks, the culture of origin and the dominant host culture, simultaneously. This process requires the individual, particularly the second generation, to constantly engage in code-switching, adapting their language, behavior, and emotional responses to fit different contexts, such as home versus school. While offering a broader worldview, this negotiation often leads to internal tensions, feelings of being an outsider in both worlds, and a unique form of cultural and emotional labor as they mediate between their immigrant family and society.
